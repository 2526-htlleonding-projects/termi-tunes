### CLI

#### Logic

When a song is saved to a playlist it gets a autogenerated tag for example the song **"Call Me"** by **"Blondie"**
becomes **"call_me"**.
If a song with this shortcut already exists then the artist name is added at the end so for example the song **"Call Me"
** by **"Troy"** becomes **"call_me_troy"**.
These can be changed anytime by simmply executing **termi change_nick call_me call_me_blondie**.

If you want to play a song that isnt saved in a playlist at the moment, you'll first need to **search** the song and
then **select** the fitting search result, it will then be added to a playlist called **"Recents"** from where you can 
add it to other playlist by exicuting **add call_me "Old Bangers"**.

You can let the lyrics be displayed by excicuting **lyr**, then you can change the theme of those lyrics and the whole
CLI and TUI with **ctheme blue** or list all themes with **ltheme** and then select the one you want with the number
keys.

If you want to change the device youre playing on, you have to excecute **spotify**, this will switch you to spotify
only mode where you'll be able to pick your device with **cdevice "Pendelins Fire TV Cube"** or just use **ldevice** to
list all and then selcet the one you want with the number keys.
